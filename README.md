## Introduction

## Scripts

The interpretation of Q-Q plots:

-**Perfectly Normal Distribution:** If the points in the Q-Q plot lie perfectly along a straight line (the red line in your case), it suggests that the sample distribution is very close to a normal distribution.

Deviation from Normality: Any deviations from the straight line indicate departures from normality. If the points deviate upward, it suggests heavier tails than a normal distribution. If they deviate downward, it suggests lighter tails.

S-shaped Curve: If the points create an S-shaped curve, it indicates skewness in the data. The direction of the S-shape tells you about the direction of skewness.

Outliers: Points that deviate significantly from the line could be outliers.

In summary, a Q-Q plot provides a visual assessment of whether a dataset follows a particular theoretical distribution (in this case, the normal distribution). The closer the points are to the straight line, the closer the data is to the specified distribution.
